# Bible Web

This is the frontend for [bible-api](https://github.com/berinaniesh/bible-api) and is available [here](https://bible.berinaniesh.xyz) and [here](https://thebible.pp.ua).

No promises are made for the reliability, availability, quality or correctness of the API or the web frontend.

Please self host if you need a more reliable service.

## Alternative frontend

An alternative frontend is being developed with note taking capabilities, bookmarks, dark mode, easier navigation, cleaner and consistent UI and much more.

The dev version can be found [here](https://bible-web-sveltekit.vercel.app) (Not completely functional yet). The source code can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/berinaniesh/bible-web-sveltekit).

No ETA.

## Placards

Each verse in it's own slide is available for the tamil version of

verses) and the source code used for creating the same is present
