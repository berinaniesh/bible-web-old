# Bible Web

This is the frontend for [bible-api](https://github.com/berinaniesh/bible-api) and is hosted [here](https://bible.berinaniesh.xyz). It's written in SvelteKit and hosted on linux servers. 

## Self hosting

Check SvelteKit's adapters for hosting instructions (I request you to self host bible api as well to ease load on my server). 

## Forks

Make sure to remove my google verification html file from the `/static` folder.
